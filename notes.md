# TreeDoc

## Idea: 
A program that makes a nice image out of a dict tree.
it should work on linux and Windows. 

## TODO:
- draw the lines for the tree structure visualization:
    do this by taking every directory that has children,
    then just connect the dots of the directory and the dots of the children
- make the image look nice with icons for different file types
- same the image in desired place
- add functionality like where to save, interactivity, changeing values, choose font
- .dirdocignore
- setup scrip
- anker at top left for text btw
