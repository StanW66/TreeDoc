## Idea: 
A program that makes a nice image out of a dict tree.
it should work on linux and maybe Windows. 
it works on both now but doing the setup for windows might be to much. Linux has precedent.

## TODO:
- figure out how to execute in a folder and use that directory accordingly.
    it will allready do that with just a .
- setup script
    - .treedocignore in the project
    - directory in ~ and store everything there
    - reference to it in path
- use sys to read arguments and make it into a commandline util!
- implement #comments in .tdignore
- put all the global variables in classes. maybe tree and canvas.
