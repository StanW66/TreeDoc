## Idea: 
A program that makes a nice image out of a dict tree.
it should work on linux and maybe Windows. 
it works on both now but doing the setup for windows might be to much. Linux has precedent.

## TODO:
- setup script
    - .treedocignore in the project
    - directory in ~ and store everything there
    - reference to it in path
- main function: pack all the stuff for runniung it in there. 
- implement project name!!!
