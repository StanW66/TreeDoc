## Idea: 
A program that makes a nice image out of a dict tree.
it should work on linux and maybe Windows. 
it works on both now but doing the setup for windows might be to much. Linux has precedent.

now you can install it anywhere you like
you just need to export that path to var

use source setup.sh to do that. 
the path is still hardcoded. i want the bash script to figure out where it is by itself.
