## Idea: 
A program that makes a nice image out of a dict tree.
it should work on linux and Windows. 

## TODO:

- .treedocignore
- setup script
- figure out why the black background for the pngs

- line_increment is not defined with font size
- if font size changes the program will break
- use the get_text_dimensions function to figure that out

- save the image in desired place -> this is going to depend on how i use it. 
- add functionality like where to save, interactivity, changeing values, choose font
